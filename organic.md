## Some famous organic chemists
-[Vladimir Markovnikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Markovnikov) formulated the Markovnikov's rule when a protic acid (such as HCl) reacts with an assymmetric alkene, H is attached to the C that has most hydrogen atoms. CH3CHCH2 + HCl -> CH3CHClCH3.

##Suzuki Coupling Reaction
-[Suzuki-Miyaura] (https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Inorganic_Chemistry)/Catalysis/Catalyst_Examples/Suzuki-Miyaura_Coupling) An important tool for linking too substitutents together. One molecule needs to have a Boric Acid component, while the other molecule needs a halogen. Please see the link for more information.
